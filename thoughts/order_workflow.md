# Order workflow

## 1. Product Browsing

* **User Action:** An authenticated user navigates to the product catalog page. 
* **System Action:** The system retrieves a list of available products from the database and displays them to the user. This list may include product details like name, description, price, images, and availability.

## 2. Product Selection

* **User Action:** The user selects a product they wish to purchase and adds it to their cart. 
* **System Action:**
  * The system checks if the user already has an active cart. If not, a new cart is created and associated with the user.
  * The selected product and the desired quantity are added to the user's cart. 
  * The cart details (items, quantities, and total price) are updated and displayed to the user.

## 3. Cart Review and Modification

* **User Action:** The user reviews the items in their cart. They can:
  * **Modify quantities:** Increase or decrease the quantity of any item.
  * **Remove items:** Remove items from the cart.
  * **Continue shopping:** Add more products to the cart.

* **System Action:** The system dynamically updates the cart details (total price, etc.) as the user modifies the cart contents.

## 4. Checkout

* **User Action:** The user proceeds to the checkout page.
* **System Action:**
  * The system displays the order summary, including:
    * Shipping address (if applicable)
    * Billing address
    * Shipping method (if applicable)
    * Payment options
    * Total order amount

## 5. Payment

* **User Action:** The user selects a payment method (credit card, debit card, PayPal, etc.) and enters their payment information.
* **System Action:**
  * The system processes the payment through the chosen payment gateway.
  * Upon successful payment:
    * A new order is created in the database.
    * Order details (user ID, order date, status, total amount, etc.) are recorded.
    * Order items (product ID, quantity, price) are recorded.
    * The order status is set to "Pending" or "Processing."
    * The cart associated with the order is either emptied or archived.

## 6. Order Fulfillment

* **System Action:**
  * The system triggers order fulfillment processes (e.g., inventory updates, shipping notifications).
  * The order status may be updated to "Shipped" or "Delivered" as the order progresses.

## 7. Order Confirmation

* **System Action:** An order confirmation email or notification is sent to the user, including order details, tracking information (if applicable), and customer support contact information.

## 8. Order Tracking (Optional)

* **User Action:** The user can track the status of their order through the app or website.
* **System Action:** The system provides real-time updates on the order status (e.g., "Shipped," "Out for Delivery," "Delivered").
